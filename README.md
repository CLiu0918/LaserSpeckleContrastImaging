# LaserSpeckleContrastImaging
The aim of this project is to theoretically analyze the deviation existing in laser speckle imaging for blood 
flow measurement. 
The computational simulation code is to test the relative error resulting from different factors, three parts are included:
(1) error from choosing wrong field autocorrelation function
(2) error from using wrong value of the optical parameter beta
(3) error from neglecting static scattering effect
